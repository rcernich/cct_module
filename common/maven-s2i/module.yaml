description: "Provides basic maven support for OpenShift S2I images."
version: "2.0"
release: "dev"
envs:
    - name: MAVEN_VERSION
      value: "3.3.9-2.8.el7"
    - name: PATH
      value: $PATH:"/usr/local/s2i"
    - name: MAVEN_ARGS
      description: Arguments to use when calling Maven, replacing the default `package hawt-app:build -DskipTests -e`. Please be sure to run the `hawt-app:build` goal (when not already bound to the `package` execution phase), otherwise the startup scripts won't work.
      example: "-e -Popenshift -DskipTests -Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.redhatga package"
    - name: MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND
      description: Additional Maven arguments.
      example: "-X -am -pl"
    - name: ARTIFACT_DIR
      description: Path to `target/` where the jar files are created for Maven multi module builds. These are added to **$MAVEN_ARGS**.
      example: "plugins/"
    - name: ARTIFACT_COPY_ARGS
      description: Arguments to use when copying artifacts from the output directory to the application directory. Useful to specify which artifacts will be part of the image. It defaults to `-r hawt-app/*` when a `hawt-app` directory is found on the build directory, otherwise jar files only will be included (`*.jar`).
      example: "-r hawt-app/*"
    - name: MAVEN_CLEAR_REPO
      description: If set then the Maven repository is removed after the artifact is built. This is useful for keeping the created application image small, but prevents *incremental* builds. Defaults to *false*.
      example: "true"
    - name: MAVEN_MIRROR_URL
      description: The base URL of a mirror used for retrieving artifacts.
      example: "http://10.0.0.1:8080/repository/internal/"
